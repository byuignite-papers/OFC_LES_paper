abstract = {Like the spherical harmonics method, the discrete ordinate method is a tool to transform the equation of transfer (for a gray medium, or on a spectral basis) into a set of simultaneous partial differential equations. Like the PN-method, the discrete ordinates or SN-method may be carried out to any arbitrary order and accuracy, although the mathematical formulation of high-order SN-schemes is considerably less involved. First proposed by Chandrasekhar [1] in his work on stellar and atmospheric radiation, the \{SN\} -method originally received little attention in the heat transfer community. Again like the \{PN\} -method, the discrete ordinates method was first systematically applied to problems in neutron transport theory, notably by Lee [2] and Lathrop [3, 4]. There were some early, unoptimized attempts to apply the method to onedimensional, planar thermal radiation problems (Love et al. [5, 6], Hottel et al. [7], Roux and Smith [8, 9]). But only during the past thirty years has the discrete ordinates method been applied to, and optimized for, general radiative heat transfer problems, primarily through the pioneering works of Fiveland [10–13] and Truelove [14–16].},

        abstract = {Scale-bridging models are created to capture desired characteristics of high-fidelity mod- els within low-fidelity model-forms, for the purpose of allowing models to function at required spacial and/or temporal scales. The development, analysis, and application of scale-bridging models will be the focus of this dissertation. The applications dictating scales herein are large-scale computational fluid dynamics codes. Three unique scale-bridging models will be presented. First, the development and validation of a multiple-polymorph, particle precipitation modeling framework for highly supersaturated CaCO3 systems will be presented. This precipitation framework is validated against literature data as well as explored for additional avenues of validation and potential future applications. Following this will be an introduction to the concepts of validation and uncertainty quantification and an approach for credible simulation development based upon those concepts. The credible simulation development approach is demonstrated through a spring-mass-damper pedagogical example. Bayesian statistical methods are commonly applied to validation and uncertainty quantification issues and the well-known Kennedy O'Hagan approach towards model-form uncertainty will be explored thoroughly using a chemical kinetics pedagogical example. Additional issues and ideas surrounding model-form uncertainty such as the identification problem will also be considered. Bayesian methods will then be applied towards the creation of a scale-bridging model for coal particle heat capacity and enthalpy modeling. Lastly, an alternative validation and uncertainty quantification technique, known as consistency testing, will be utilized to create a scale-bridging model for coal particle devolatilization. The credibility of the devolatilization scale-bridging model due to the model development process is assessed and found to have benefited from the use of validation and uncertainty quantification practices.},

The process of transition from conventional combustion in air to the oxy-combustion technology, however, requires a thorough investigations of the phenomena occurring during the combustion process, that can be greatly supported by numerical modeling. The paper presents the results of numerical simulations of pulverized coal combustion process in swirl burner using RANS (Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations) and LES (large Eddy simulation) methods for turbulent flow. Numerical simulations have been performed for the oxyfuel test facility located at the Institute of Heat and Mass Transfer at RWTH Aachen University. Detailed analysis of the flow field inside the combustion chamber for cold flow and for the flow with combustion using different numerical methods for turbulent flows have been done. Comparison of the air and oxy-coal combustion process for pulverized coal shows significant differences in temperature, especially close to the burner exit. Additionally the influence of the combustion model on the results has been shown for oxy-combustion test case.},

  abstract = {Oxy-fuel combustion has generated significant interest since it was proposed as a carbon capture technology for newly built and retrofitted coal-fired power plants. Research, development and demonstration of oxy-fuel combustion technologies has been advancing in recent years; however, there are still fundamental issues and technological challenges that must be addressed before this technology can reach its full potential, especially in the areas of combustion in oxygen-carbon dioxide environments and potentially at elevated pressures. This paper presents a technical review of oxy-coal combustion covering the most recent experimental and simulation studies, and numerical models for sub-processes are also used to examine the differences between combustion in an oxidizing stream diluted by nitrogen and carbon dioxide. The evolution of this technology from its original inception for high temperature processes to its current form for carbon capture is introduced, followed by a discussion of various oxy-fuel systems proposed for carbon capture. Of all these oxy-fuel systems, recent research has primarily focused on atmospheric air-like oxy-fuel combustion in a CO2-rich environment. Distinct heat and mass transfer, as well as reaction kinetics, have been reported in this environment because of the difference between the physical and chemical properties of {CO2} and N2, which in turn changes the flame characteristics. By tracing the physical and chemical processes that coal particles experience during combustion, the characteristics of oxy-fuel combustion are reviewed in the context of heat and mass transfer, fuel delivery and injection, coal particle heating and moisture evaporation, devolatilization and ignition, char oxidation and gasification, as well as pollutants formation. Operation under elevated pressures has also been proposed for oxy-coal combustion systems in order to improve the overall energy efficiency. The potential impact of elevated pressures on oxy-fuel combustion is discussed when applicable. Narrower flammable regimes and lower laminar burning velocity under oxy-fuel combustion conditions may lead to new stability challenges in operating oxy-coal burners. Recent research on stabilization of oxy-fuel combustion is reviewed, and some guiding principles for retrofit are summarized. Distinct characteristics in oxy-coal combustion necessitate modifications of {CFD} sub-models because the approximations and assumptions for air-fuel combustion may no longer be valid. Advances in sub-models for turbulent flow, heat transfer and reactions in oxy-coal combustion simulations, and the results obtained using {CFD} are reviewed. Based on the review, research needs in this combustion technology are suggested.},

The simulation results are compared to experimental data obtained for the inlet stoichiometric ratios of 0.14, 0.22, and 0.36. An accurate and computationally inexpensive devolatilization model suitable for combustion simulation in {LES} is proposed and incorporated into the LES. The numerical results of gas temperature and coal burnout on the centerline show good agreement with the experimental data. Two kinds of lift-off heights are introduced to verify the combustion simulation. One is the height from the primary nozzle exit to the starting point of the growing flame region. The other is the height from the primary nozzle exit to the starting point of the continuous flame region. The calculated results of the two lift-off heights show good agreement with the experimental data. In contrast to LES, the standard k–ε model overestimates the lift-off heights because it calculates time-averaged temperature which does not contain information about local flame structure. The stoichiometric ratio in the gas phase at the starting point of the growing flame region is found to be independent of the inlet stoichiometric ratio in the range from 0.14 to 0.36. },

  abstract  = {A semiempirical model has been developed for predicting coal-derived soot. The main feature of the model is a transport equation for soot mass fraction. Tar prediction options include either an empirical or a transport equation approach, which directly impacts the source term for soot formation. Also, the number of soot particles per unit mass of gas may be calculated using either a transport equation or an assumed average. Kinetics are based on Arrhenius rates taken from published measurements. Radiative properties are calculated as a function of averaged optical constants, predicted gas temperatures, predicted gas densities, and the soot mass fractions. This model has been incorporated into a comprehensive coal modeling code and evaluated based on comparisons with soot, temperature, and NOx measurements for three experimental cases. Accurate predictions of soot yields have been achieved for both laminar and turbulent coal flames. Larger scale turbulent predictions illustrated that inclusion of a soot model changed the local gas temperatures by as much as 300 K and the local NOx concentration by as much as 250 ppm. These predictions demonstrate the necessity for an accurate soot model in coal combustion systems.},

One was an Imjuiden block, variable swirl, 150 kWth burner in the Burner Flow Reactor (BFR) at Brigham Young University. The second was a fixed-swirl vane (30°), 40 kWth burner in the oxy-fuel combustor (OFC) at the University of Utah. In both burners, three stoichiometric ratios (SRs) and three oxygen volume fractions in the secondary oxidizer stream were investigated with measurements collected at three axial positions. In the OFC, two coals were investigated with simulated flue gas recirculation (FGR, O2 in CO2) and warm FGR. In the BFR, two coals were investigated, one with warm recycle (420 °F) and the other with cold recycled flue gas. In the BFR, at high swirl (1.36), the flame was attached, and the amount of soot was found to correlate strongly with the secondary mass flow rate. Increasing flow rate produced shorter, more active flames and less soot indicating increased mixing. In the OFC, the flame was lifted. The air-fired flame was more lifted than the two oxy-fired flames (simulated FGR and warm FGR) and produced less soot. Soot for all flames decreased slightly with increased distance from the flame root where soot volume fraction was highest. The bituminous coal produced more soot than the sub-bituminous coal. Measured soot volume fractions ranged from 10 to 200 × 10−9. The data show that the local SR of the fuel rich region has a more significant impact than the overall SR and the type of oxidant (air, O2/FGR, or O2/CO2).},

  abstract  = {Oxy-fuel combustion of coal is a promising technology for cost-effective power production with carbon capture and sequestration that has ancillary benefits of emission reductions and lower flue gas cleanup costs. To fully understand the results of pilot-scale tests of oxy-fuel combustion and to accurately predict scale-up performance through CFD modeling, fundamental data are needed concerning coal and coal char combustion properties under these unconventional conditions. In the work reported here, the ignition and devolatilization characteristics of both a high-volatile bituminous coal and a Powder River Basin subbituminous coal were analyzed in detail through single-particle imaging at a gas temperature of 1700 K over a range of 12–36 vol % O2 in both N2 and CO2 diluent gases. The bituminous coal images show large, hot soot cloud radiation whose size and shape vary with oxygen concentration and, to a lesser extent, with the use of N2 versus CO2 diluent gas. Subbituminous coal images show cooler, smaller emission signals during devolatilization that have the same characteristic size as the coal particles introduced into the flow (nominally 100 μm). The measurements also demonstrate that the use of CO2 diluent retards the onset of ignition and increases the duration of devolatilization, once initiated. For a given diluent gas, a higher oxygen concentration yields shorter ignition delay and devolatilization times. The effect of CO2 on coal particle ignition is explained by its higher molar specific heat and its tendency to reduce the local radical pool. The effect of O2 on coal particle ignition results from its effect on the local mixture reactivity. CO2 decreases the rate of devolatilization because of the lower mass diffusivity of volatiles in CO2 mixtures, whereas higher O2 concentrations increase the mass flux of oxygen to the volatiles flame and thereby increase the rate of devolatilization.},

Dispersion formulas are developed for interpolating the data between 0.8 and 2.5μ. The results are used to calculate the spectral absorption coefficient and the total emissivities of soot suspensions. It is shown that the correct values of the optical constants are needed in the use of light-scattering techniques for the measurement of the soot concentration but that uncertainties introduced in flux calculations by use of approximate values of the optical constants are not greater than those introduced by the present uncertainties in the values of the soot concentration.},

The dispersion constants of hydrocarbon soot have been determined from this model in conjunction with the in-situ flame transmission data in the visible and infrared ranges, thus truly reflecting soot in flames. It is shown that the soot optical properties are rather insensitive to temperature changes at elevated temperatures but the room temperature values representative of soot in smoke do exhibit appreciable deviation. The results also indicate these properties to be relatively independent of the fuel hydrogen/carbon ratio.},

  abstract  = {The implementation of a population balance equation (PBE) in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) represents a crucial element in the simulation of multiphase flows. Some of the available methods, such as classes methods (CM) and Monte Carlo (MC) methods, are computationally expensive and simulation of real cases of practical interest requires intractable CPU times. On the other hand, other methods such as the method of moments (MOM) are computationally affordable but have proven to be inaccurate for a number of cases. In recent work a new closure, the quadrature method of moments (QMOM), has been introduced, applied and validated. In our earlier work, QMOM was shown to be an efficient and accurate method for tracking the moments of the particle size distribution (PSD) in a CFD simulation. However, QMOM presents two main disadvantages: (i) if applied to multi-variate distributions it loses simplicity and efficiency, and (ii) by tracking only the moments of the PSD, it does not represent realistically polydisperse systems with strong coupling between the internal coordinates and phase velocities. In order to address these issues, in this work the direct quadrature method of moments (DQMOM) is formulated, validated, and tested. DQMOM is based on the idea of tracking directly the variables appearing in the quadrature approximation, rather than tracking the moments of the PSD. Nevertheless, for monovariate cases we show that QMOM and DQMOM yield identical results. In addition, we show how it is possible to extend the DQMOM to multivariate cases and some of relevant theoretical and numerical issues are discussed. These issues are discussed in the present work for homogeneous and one-dimensional flows. References to recent CFD applications of DQMOM to multiphase flows are provided as further proof of the utility of the method.},

The mass flow rates of soot were determined together with the local temperatures and the partial pressures of the oxygen at successive stages of the reaction. The change in size of the soot particles (initial particle size about 400 Å) was followed by electron micrographs. A semi-empirical rate equation was worked out from the experimental data which gave the specific rate of reaction (g. cm−2. sec−1) as a function of the temperature and the partial pressure of the oxygen

Temperature and concentration profiles of stable gases and condensed phases combustion products were measured along the flame axis. It was found that the high flame temperature conditions cause a larger decomposition of methane into hydrogen and C2–C4 hydrocarbons, thereby reducing the formation of benzene and condensed phases including condensed species and soot. Soot properties were studied by UV–Visible absorption spectroscopy, thermogravimetry and H/C elemental analysis. A description of soot nanostructural organization was also performed by means of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Different properties and nanostructures were found to develop in the soot, depending on the temperature and on soot aging associated. Soot dehydrogenation occurred to a larger extent in the high flame temperature conditions. As soot dehydrogenates the mass absorption coefficients of soot exhibited an increasing trend along the flame axis. However, mature soot retained a relatively high H/C ratio and low absorption coefficients with respect to other less hydrogenated fuels even in high temperature conditions. This indicates that the aromatization/dehydrogenation of soot in premixed flames is more dependent on the fuel characteristics rather than on the flame temperature.

Generally, it was assessed that mature soot produced from diverse hydrocarbon fuels with similar flame temperatures and flame types possess a different chemical composition and structure. To this regard the H/C atomic ratio and mass absorption coefficients appeared to be signatures of soot properties and structural evolution.},

The joint simulation effort of three research groups at Freiberg University (FG), Imperial College (IC) and Stuttgart University (ST) is presented, and the details of the comprehensive coal combustion models and their numerical implementation in three different computer programs are discussed. The (standard) coal sub-models and parameters used by the different groups are unified wherever possible. Differences amongst the groups are a different code basis and an Eulerian treatment of the coal particles by IC, while FG and ST use the Lagrangian framework for particle transport. The flow modelling is first validated for the corresponding non-reacting case and all LES calculations accurately capture the experimental trends. Velocity field statistics for the PCC case are in good accordance with the experimental evidence, but scalar statistics illustrate the complexity of coal combustion modelling. The results show notable differences amongst the groups that cannot only be attributed to the different treatment of the particle phase, and they highlight the difficulty to assess and interpret the quality of specific modelling approaches, and a need for further work by the research community. The present study is the first to compare three originally independent transient coal simulations and a step towards comprehensive PCC-LES.},

The two-dimensional, Favre-filtered, compressible Navier-Stokes, total sensible energy and mixture fraction equations are closed using the Smagorinsky subgrid-scale (SGS) turbulence model. Major species of gas-phase combustion are obtained using a laminar flamelet model by employing experimentally obtained laminar flame state relationships for the major species mass fractions as a function of gas-phase mixture fraction. A combination of a presumed Beta filtered density function and a scale-similarity model are used to account for SGS mixture fraction and scalar dissipation fluctuations on the filtered composition and heat release rate. A soot transport and finite-rate kinetics model accounting for soot nucleation, surface growth, agglomeration, and oxidation is used. Radiation is modeled by integrating the filtered radiative transfer equation using the discrete ordinates method. Both instantaneous and time-averaged results are presented in order to highlight physical and numerical modeling issues and to examine turbulence, soot chemistry, and radiation interactions. Qualitative comparisons are made to previous numerical results and experimental data.},
